# Beta Series Classifier: A fastai project. 

This is an image classification project I put together whilst working through the first few lessons of the Fast AI course (https://www.fast.ai/). 
A lot of the code is taken from there, however I had to implement a workaround to get the images from Bing, and as the commit history shows I was 
having some issues deploying to Heroku. The result is admittedly not as polished as I would like it to be. 

Further details are in the link, but the long and short of it is that the model takes the image of a scene from a select number of television series
and predicts which series it is from.
